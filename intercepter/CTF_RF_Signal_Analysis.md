# RF Signal Analysis CTF

**Assets provided:**
- `pass_ctf.iq` - complex float32 baseband IQ recording
- `pass_ctf.json` - metadata for the IQ recording

## Download the files [here](./ctf_1_files.zip) and **unzip** them

**Tools you will need:** GNU Radio Companion, Python 3 (numpy, hashlib, struct, binascii)

**Scenario:** Your team has intercepted a downlink pass from an unknown satellite.
You have the raw IQ recording and nothing else. Decode it, extract what is inside,
and derive the uplink authentication token.

---

**Q1. What is the sample rate of the `pass_ctf.iq` recording?**

---

**Q2. What sync word marks the start of each frame in the bitstream?
Give your answer in hexadecimal.**

---

**Q3. What modulation scheme was used to transmit this signal?**

---

**Q4. What is the symbol rate of this downlink in bits per second?**

---

**Q5. What is the FSK frequency deviation in Hz?**

---

**Q6. How many IQ samples represent exactly one transmitted symbol?
Show your working.**

---

**Q7. What is the satellite name embedded in the telemetry payload?**

---

**Q8. What Unix epoch timestamp is embedded in the telemetry payload?**

---

**Q9. Using the satellite name and epoch you extracted, compute the uplink
authentication token. What is it?**

---

**Q10. What integrity algorithm protects each frame, and which bytes does it cover?
Be specific about what is included and what is excluded.**
